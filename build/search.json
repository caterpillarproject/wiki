This depends on the availability of computing time and the limitations of hardware. At the moment we are running many simulations at the same time. This only occurs in bursts when we have available time and we personally have time to oversee them. Each simulation takes roughly 300k hours (exluding halo finding ~2 weeks + postprocessing which is ~1-3 days). With all of these time heavy tasks, we still estimate to have the full sample by Spring/Summer of 2016.                                                                                                                                                                                                    What is the authorship policy?                                                                                                                                        Since the collaboration is quite small there is a lot of room to grow with new science. That being said, there are a few core projects which the collaboration is working towards (see the on-going projects page). Provided there is no overlap with the core science projects of the collaboration the data is freely available for anyone who would like to use it. Naturally we hope you collaborate with people within the group so you can achieve your goals as soon as possible as many of us have had years creating/analyzing the data.                                                                                                                                                                                                    How is the data going to be released to the public?                                                                                                                                        At the moment, we don't have a full plan in place for complete open access to the data so for the moment individuals are being given access an analysis node at MIT (bigbang). Through this portal, the entire suite is available. The size of the data (300TB+ and growing) makes it difficult to find a one size fits all solution to the public release. We are working with Illustris folks at Harvard to see if there are some optimum ways to deal this kind of load.                                                                                                                                                                                                    Will the Caterpillar halos be run with gas/hydro?                                                                                                                                        The short answer is yes, eventually. We have already setup and run gas runs of the parent simulation and are in the process of running hydro runs for the zoom-in simulations. There are many more pieces to this next stage of the project and they are still being interally reviwed (i.e. sure hydro, but _which_ flavour?). This wiki will update the status of the hydro runs in due course.

The code is freely available to the community though if it is a non-trivial tool, we ask if you keep the developers (Alex, Greg and Brendan) in the loop so you done become unstuck using the code for the wrong reasons. Similarly, we may be able to help you get a given tool tailored for your own purposes so please let us know if you would like any assistance.

Yes, Caterpillar is a dark matter only simulation. Though, that being said quite a lot can be learned from this simulation suite alone. Our main goal however is to run sophisticated semi-analytic models over the merger trees to generate mock galaxies (i.e. with stellar masses, cold gas fractions, morphologies etc.). The Munich SAM is currently being run over the Caterpillar halos and will produce a fantastic data set to do all sorts of analysis (e.g. assembly of the stellar halo, chemical tagging, stellar streams).

"summary": "To get started with the Caterpillar project, first make sure you have a firm understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the data.",
"body": "A Brief HistoryThe Caterpillar project was the brainchild of Prof. Anna Frebel and Lars Hernquist at a meeting at the CfA in 2013. Phillip Zukin was then a PhD student under Edmund Bertschinger who was temporarily employed to carry out the first parent volume simulations that would become the Caterpillar project. His work continued until Brendan Griffen arrived as the new postdoc to take charge of the project in its entirety. Graduate students Greg Dooley and Alex Ji are also working part time on the project. At a conference at UC Irvine in early 2014 between Anna Frebel, Brian O&#39;Shea, Brendan Griffen and Facundo Gomez, it was agreed that we would combined datasets and future efforts (Brian and Facundo had a similar sized project for studying stellar halos at the time). In September of 2015, the first Caterpillar paper was put on arxiv.MotivationThe Caterpillar project is a large simulation suite of dark matter halos of mass similar in size to that of the Milky Way. By virtue of the extremely large number of halos, temporal and spatial resolution of the simulations, it is the largest simulation suite of its kind in the world. We plan to extend this initial release sample to 70 halos in total. Many of these 70 halos have already completed but are currently unpublished. All halos are accessible to the community by contacting the collaboration.The goal of the Caterpillar Project is to use these relatively inexpensive dark matter simulations to:statistically probe the merger history of Milky Way-like galaxies,understand the origin and evolution of the satellite systems of Milky Way-like galaxies anddetermine to what extent the Milky Way is unusual relative to its similar sized cousins.Summary of Method: Tip:  Much more detail of the Caterpillar project can be found in Griffen et al. (2015).The Caterpillar suite was run using P-Gadget3 and Gadget4, tree-based n-body codes based on Gadget2 (Springel et al. 2005). For the underlying cosmological model we adopt the \\(\\Lambda\\)CDM parameter set characterised by a Planck cosmology given by, \\(\\Omega_m=0.32\\), \\(\\Omega_\\Lambda=0.68\\), \\(\\Omega_b=0.05\\), \\(n_s=0.96\\), \\(\\sigma_8=0.83\\) and Hubble constant, H = 100 \\(h\\ km\\ s^{-1}\\ Mpc^{-1}\\) = 67.11 \\(km\\ s^{-1}\\ Mpc^{-1}\\) (Planck et al. 2014). All initial conditions were constructed using music (Hahn &amp; Able 2011).  We identify dark matter halos via Rockstar (Behroozi et al. 2013) and construct merger trees using consistent-trees (Behroozi et al. 2012). Rockstar assigns virial masses to halos, \\(M_{vir}\\), using the evolution of the virial relation from Bryan &amp; Norman (1998). for our particular cosmology. At z = 0, this definition corresponds to an over-density of 97x the critical density of the Universe. We have modified rockstar to output all particles belonging to each halo so we can reconstruct any halo property in post-processing if required. We have also improved the code to include iterative unbinding. In our work, we restrict our definition of virial mass to include only those particles which are bound to the halo."

MUSIC is a computer program to generate nested grid initial conditions for high-resolution &quot;zoom&quot; cosmological simulations. A detailed description of the algorithms can be found in Hahn &amp; Abel (2011). You can download the user&#39;s guide here or obtain a copy of the code here. Any questions should be directed to Brendan Griffen and then if that fails, Oliver Hahn.ParametersThese are the parameter files which were used to generate the initial coditions for the Caterpillar project. We adopt the raw Planck (2013) cosmology and do not use 2nd order lagrangian perturbation theory. The user guide contains all the information required to understand the following parameter files. Within each simulation directory, there is a file named OUTPUTmusic which gives the log of the construction of the initial conditions.Parent SimulationFirst we constructed a parent simulation of sufficient size to include thousands of Milky Way sized systems but also of sufficient resolution to construct good lagrangian volumes. We decided on ~10,000 particles per Milky Way-sized host and a 100 Mpc/h volume. Our level_max is 10 below, which means our parent simulation&#39;s effective resolution is (210)3 = (1024)3 (i.e. a particle mass of 8.72 x 107 \\(M_\\odot/h\\).If you have access to the MIT cluster (bigbang.mit.edu), you can access the parent simulation data here: /bigbang/data/AnnaGroup/caterpillar/parent/gL100X10/.

First is we now specify a region_point_file which defines the x,y,z (normalized to the box width) of the particles to be resampled. We have added the parameter hipadding which our own modification to allow for expanded regions. 1.05, for example, represents an expanded ellipsoid (by 5%). See Section 2.3 of Griffen et al. (2015) for a more detailed description of these geometries and their impact on contamination.We also draw the reader&#39;s attention to the seed values. Note that we do not set the seed values for any level lower than the parent volume (10) which makes MUSIC smooth out any levels lower than 10. The seed values at 11 are simply the halo numbers and then each level higher scales by a factor of 2 of this original number. This was required because the ICs were generated through our automatic pipeline and each simulation needs unique values to seed the random noise field. The levelmin_TF is also set to be the same as the parent volume (10). The padding and overlap parameters are the same for all simulations.# H1079897_EX_Z127_P7_LN7_LX14_O4_NV4.conf[setup]boxlength            = 100zstart               = 127levelmin             = 7levelmin_TF          = 10levelmax             = 14padding              = 7overlap              = 4region               = ellipsoidhipadding            = 1.05region_point_file    = /n/home01/bgriffen/data/caterpillar/ics/lagr/H1079897NRVIR4align_top            = nobaryons              = nouse_2LPT             = nouse_2LLA             = noperiodic_TF          = yes[cosmology]Omega_m              = 0.3175Omega_L              = 0.6825Omega_b              = 0.049H0                   = 67.11sigma_8              = 0.8344nspec                = 0.9624transfer             = eisenstein[random]seed[10]              = 34567seed[11]              = 1079897seed[12]              = 2159794seed[13]              = 3239691seed[14]              = 4319588[output]format               = gadget2_doublefilename             = ./icsgadget_num_files     = 8gadget_spreadcoarse  = yes[poisson]fft_fine             = yesaccuracy             = 1e-05pre_smooth           = 3post_smooth          = 3smoother             = gslaplace_order        = 6grad_order           = 6"

You can also used openMP multi-threaded jobs which require large amounts of memory (1 job per node). At this stage, there are no time-limits or fixed memory limits for each of the nodes.Analysis Node (for plotting, running scripts etc.)The Frebel group as MIT also has access to an analysis node which is connected to the Caterpillar data called bigbang. It can be accessed via ssh username@bigbang.mit.edu. See Data Access on this site to get started with your analysis once you understand the storage layout below.Storage File Systems/ServersThe Frebel group has access to ~120GB RAID storage and 300TB+ of ZFS tape storage. The ZFS tape storage consists of two 130TB servers (grinder and cruncher). These are significantly slower to do I/O from the first time. They each have solid state drives on them acting as a large cache which makes reading data comparable to the RAID drives if you are repeatedly accessing the same snapshot on the tape, for example. The directory structure is as follows:login node: ssh username@bigbang.mit.edu# ZFS TAPE STORAGE SERVERS (not as fast as the RAID  slow to load) -&gt; cruncher/  -&gt; caterpillar/   -&gt; parent/   -&gt; halos/    -&gt; H1079897/ -&gt; grinder/  # ZFS tape drive with   -&gt; caterpillar/   -&gt; halos/    -&gt; H1387186    ...  -&gt; aquarius/   -&gt; Aq-A/   -&gt; Aq-B/   -&gt; Aq-C/   -&gt; Aq-D/   -&gt; Aq-E/   -&gt; Aq-F/# RAID STORAGE -&gt; data/AnnaGroup/     # RAID drive with all runs lower than LX14  -&gt; caterpillar/   -&gt; halos/            # master folder with all of the caterpillar data within    -&gt; H1079897/        # halos are named according to their folders    ...   -&gt; ics/    -&gt; lagr/            # lagrangian volume files   -&gt; parent/           # parent simulation runs    -&gt; gL100X10/        # actual parent simulation (X10 refers to Level_max=10 in MUSIC)Current Storage StatusWe are quite limited with storage space and so we ask you to request more storage if you need it. You will then be allocated a directory on bigbang/data/{username}/. The current break down of the storage capability is as follows:bigbang% df -hFilesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on/dev/mapper/vg_bigbang-lv_home                       57G  1.9G   52G   4% /home/dev/mapper/vg_bigdata-lv_bigdata                      121T   93T   28T  78% /bigbang/data/cruncher/data                      127T  114T   14T  90% /cruncher/data/grinder/data                      127T   74T   54T  59% /grinder/data/spacebase/data                       36T   33M   36T   1% /spacebase/dataWhere is the data actually stored?Due to our storage limitations we have opted for the following strategyyou should only ever get your hpaths from haloutils via hpaths = haloutils.get_paper_paths_lx(14), for example. Do not get your halo paths from ever going into caterpillar/halos/middle_mass_halos/*.all simulation runs lower than LX14 (i.e. LX11,12,13) have been stored on the RAID drives.all LX14 runs are symbolically linked on the RAID drives but might not actually exist physically on the drives. all halo catalogues are on the RAID drives so access for these is very fastall particle data except the last snapshot are actually stored on the ZFS tape drives (though it will appear in outputs/ as a symlink)only the last snapshot of the particle data is actually stored on the RAID drivesall postprocessed catalogues in analysis/ of each halo directory are on the RAID drivesall of the aquarius data is on the ZFS tape storage as this is not often usedthe parent simulation (gL100X10) is stored in the same way as the LX14 runs: only the last snapshot of the particle data is stored on the RAID drives, everything else is on the ZFS tape drives."

All the parameters used for the construction of the simulation were oriented around this goal.OverviewVolume  h^3 Mpc^3# particles\\(m_{dm}\\)  10^7 h^-1 \\(M_\\odot\\)\\(m_{dm}\\)  10^7 \\(M_\\odot\\)\\(\\epsilon_{dm}\\)  pc100^31024^39122441 Note:  The parent simulation initial conditions were run on an older version of MUSIC.VolumeThe volume of the parent simulation was selected to be 100 Mpc/h as this allows for roughly ~6500 Milky Way-sized (i.e. 10^12 Msol) systems to be found. After a gentle selection over local environment (i.e. making sure no halos were near clusters) 2122 candidates were used to select Caterpillar candidates.Mass ResolutionWe required a resolution which allowed us to resolve 10^12 Msol halos with 10,000 particles so as to construct well defined lagrangian volumes. This resulted in us selecting a resolution of 10243 or a particle mass of 8.72 x 107 \\(M_\\odot/h\\).Halo SelectionWe selected halos with the following environmental requirements:halos between 0.7 - 3 x 1012 \\(M_\\odot\\) (6564 candidates)no halos larger than 7 x 1013 \\(M_\\odot\\) within 7 Mpcno halos larger than 7 x 1012 \\(M_\\odot\\) within 2.8 Mpc (2122 candidates)This is roughly in line with Tollerud et al. (2012), Boylan-Kolchin et al. (2013), Fardal et al. (2013), Pfiffel et al. (2013), Li &amp; White (2008), van der Marel et al. (2012), Karachentsev et al. (2004) and Tikhonov &amp; Klypin (2009). This avoids Milky Way-sized systems near clusters but does not make them overly isolated necessarily. Halos were also selected to not be preferentially near the very edge of the simulation volume as a matter of convenience. The first 24 Caterpillar halos are highlighted within the parent volume below.Temporal ResolutionThe time steps were set to be log of the expansion factor, following a similar convention to that used by the Millenium and Millenium-II simulations.

"summary": "The Caterpillar project primarily uses Rockstar for its halo finding. Here you can find an overview of the code and the properties of the halos you might want to access.",
"body": "OverviewRockstar identifies dark matter halos, substructure, and tidal features in phase space.The approach is based on adaptive hierarchical refinement of friends-of-friends groups in six dimensions, which allows for robust (grid-independent, shape-independent, and noise-resilient) tracking of substructure; as such, it is named Rockstar (Robust Overdensity Calculation using K-Space Topologically Adaptive Refinement). The &quot;consistent trees&quot; algorithm for generating merger trees and halo catalogs explicitly ensures consistency of halo properties (mass, position, velocity, radius) across timesteps. The algorithm has demonstrated the ability to increase both the completeness (through inserting otherwise missing halos) and purity (through removing spurious objects) of both merger trees and halo catalogs. In addition, the method is able to robustly measure the self-consistency of halo finders; it is the first to directly measure the uncertainties in halo positions, halo velocities, and the halo mass function for a given halo finder based on actual cosmological simulations.The code&#39;s paper can be found here. Documentation on getting it running and a more exhaustive documentation of the catalogue&#39;s content at its Bitbucket Repository.Rockstar and Iterative UnbindingRockstar is able to find any overdensity in 6D phase space including both halos and streams. To distinguish gravitationally bound halos from other phase space structures, Rockstar performs a single-pass energy calculation to determine which particles are gravitationally bound to the halo. Over-densities where at least 50% ofthe mass is gravitationally bound are considered halos, with the exact fraction a tuneable parameter unbound_threshold of the algorithm Behroozi et al. (2013).This definition is generally very effective at identifying halos and subhalos -- but it fails in two important situations. First, if a subhalo is experiencing significant tidal stripping, the 50% cutoff can remove a subhalo from the catalog that should actually exist. We have found that changing the cutoff can recover the missing subhalos, but the best value of the cutoff is not easily determined. Second, Rockstar is occasionally too effective at finding substructure in our high resolution simulations. In particular, it often finds velocity substructures in the cores of our halos that are clearly spurious based on their mass accretion histories and density profiles. Importantly, these two issues do not just affect low mass subhalos, but they can also add or remove halos with \\(V_{max}\\) &gt; 25 km/s.Both of these problems can be alleviated by applying an iterative unbinding procedure. We have implemented such an iterative unbinding procedure within Rockstar. At each iteration, we remove particles whose kinetic energy exceeds the potential energy from other particles in that iteration. The potential is computed with the Rockstar Barnes-Hut method (see Appendix B of Behroozi et al. (2013). We iterate the unbinding until we obtain a self-bound set of particles. Halos are only considered resolved if they contain at least 20 self-bound particles. All halo properties are then computed as usual, but with the self-bound particles instead of the one-pass bound particles. The iterative unbinding recovers the missing subhalos and removes most but not all of the spurious subhalos. Across 13 of our Caterpillar halos, we recover 52 halos with subhalo masses above 108 \\(M_\\odot\\) which would have otherwise been lost using the conventional Rockstar. See Griffen et al. (2015) for further details.Rockstar PropertiesRockstar outputs a large number of halo properties.variableunitsdefinitionnotesidthe ID number of the haloposXMpc/hcomoving x-positionposYMpc/hcomoving y-positionposZMpc/hcomoving z-positionpecVXkm/sPeculiar x-dir velocitypecVYkm/sPeculiar y-dir velocitypecVZkm/sPeculiar z-dir velocitycorevelXkm/sx-dir core velocitycorevelYkm/sy-dir core velocitycorevelZkm/sz-dir core velocitybulkvelXcomoving km/sx-dir bulk velocitybulkvelYcomoving km/sy-dir bulk velocitybulkvelZcomoving km/sz-dir bulk velocitymvirMsol/hvirial mass set by Bryan &amp; Norman (1998) prescriptionthis should only be used for the massive host halos - it is best to just use mgravmgravMsol/hvirial mass set by Bryan &amp; Norman (1998) prescriptionwhen using the catalogues, only use this quantity as it is the gravitationally bound mass of the halo - especially for subhalosrvirkpc/hvirial radius set by Bryan &amp; Norman (1998) prescriptionchild_rvmax_rkm/smgravMsol/hgravitational massvmaxkm/sMaximum circular velocityrvmaxkpc/hradius at maximum circular velocityrskpc/hNFW scale radiusrs_klypinkpc/hKlypin defined scale radiusbetter for smaller halosvrmskm/srms velocityJxx-component angular momentumJyy-component angular momentumJzz-component angular momentumEpotPotential energy of the halospinPeebles defined spin parameterThis should only be used for halos with a large number of particles (~500+)spin_bullockBullock&#39;s modified spin parameterSee above.xoffPosition offset parameter abs(center of mass position - halo position)voffVelocity offset parameter abs(center of mass velocity - halo velocity)b_to_aHalo ellipticity b/ac_to_aHalo ellipticity c/ab_to_a2Halo ellipticity b/a (different prescription)c_to_a2Halo ellipticity c/a (different prescription)A[x]x-axis for ellipticity aA[y]y-xis for ellipticity aA[z]z-xis for ellipticity aA2[x]x-axis for ellipticity a (different prescription)A2[y]y-xis for ellipticity a (different prescription)A2[z]z-xis for ellipticity a (different prescription)T/abs(U)Virial ratio (kinetic/abs(potential))min_pos_errMinimum error in positionmin_vel_errMinimum error in bulk velocitymin_bulkvel_errMinimum bulk velocity error.total_npartThe total number of particles associated with this halo (subs included)npartThe number of particles associated with a halo (does not include subhalos)Rockstar Full Particles BinarySummary of changes for full particle binary output. 8/19/2014 (Alex Ji)Alex added a Rockstar option to be able to output in binary all of the particle ids belonging to each halo. This means there is no need to recursively get particles from subhalos in RSDataReader. It also means particles from subhalo fof groups that were deemed unbound or too small, and hence not previously written out, are now correctly written out to the halo they should belong to.Usage: Compiling When compiling Rockstar, use the command % make full_particle_binary This automatically compiles with HDF5 also.Config FileIn the Rockstar config file, specify FULL_PARTICLE_BINARY = num processors to write out full binary files This should be set to the same as NUM_WRITERS. It could be less, but I don&#39;t see any reason for that.Also specify DELETE_BINARY_OUTPUT_AFTER_FINISHED = 1 This deletes the standard .bin files. The new files contain all of the same info as the old .bin files, so they are just a waste of space.Reading DataUse RSDataReader.py version 7. There is now a new parameter called total_npart which specifies the total number of particles belonging to a halo, including substructure. get_particles_from_halo() will now return all particles from a halo. get_all_particles_from_halo() returns exactly the same thing in version=7. The first “npart” particles from any given halo are exactly the same particles you would have gotten in the original Rockstar output. The extra particles after that are the ones we were after.the files now end with the extension .fullbin instead of .binThey are ~10% larger due to the extra particles.Changes to Rockstar codeFiles Modified: config.template.h Makefile halo.h properties.c meta_io.c io_internal.c io_internal.hIn config file, will need to specify FULL_PARTICLE_BINARY = num processors to write out full binary files This config option is now added to config.template.h and by default set to 0.When compiling, specify the option: $ make full_particle_binary defines the flag FULL_PARTICLE_BINARY_FLAG This will compile a version such that the halo struct has an extra parameter total_num_p, found in halo.h. It will also compile with hdf5 since this is the case we most often want. total_num_p is assigned in properties.c in the function calc_additional_halo_props() This corresponds to the total number of particles belonging to the halo, including particles assigned to fof groups that were not printed out (for being unbound, too small, etc.) The extra parameter for each halo needs to be read in with RSDataReader.py version 7. it is named &#39;total_npart&#39; for now.In the file meta_io.c, in the function output_halos() Added another if statement that calls output_full_particles_binary() to print data as we want it. Function called only if FULL_PARTICLE_BINARY &gt; 0 as specified in config file.Wrote output_full_particles_binary() to io_internal.c. It is just like output_binary() except it uses a recursive function, print_child_particles_binary() to print all of the particles, not just num_p of them. Declared output_full_particles_binary() in io_internal.hprint_child_particles_binary() in io_internal.c is my function which is a modification of print_child_particles() to recursively trace child halos and print their particles ids to binary, not ascii. print_child_particles_binary() did not need to be declared in any header file. Just written in file before function that calls it.Output files will now be named halos_x.y.fullbin x is the snap number y is the chunk number. Ranges from 0 to FULL_PARTICLES_BINARY-1In the halo output, p_start corresponds to the starting position in the particle array p of the processor it is on where particles are belonging to that halo. We write this out as numstart in RSDataReader. It was not used before, and now shouldn&#39;t ever be used.At the moment, cat.total_particles will not be truly accurate. It will refer to the sum of npart of every halo. It would be easy to change this to refer to the sum of total_npart for each halo in RSDataReader. I don&#39;t see a good use for cat.total_particles either way though. The binary header information will specify num_particles as the sum of npart, or num_p. Changing this is a bad idea, as it will break other parts of how Rockstar is run. To specify a different particle count, such as number of unique particles written to file, or sum of total_num_p, would require an extra parameter to the struct binary_output_header, or to change num_particles just in the output. I don&#39;t see a good use for this right now.Another note: Files are not written out in order to keep halo ids written out in order. Ex: halos.0.bin might write halos 0 – 250 halos.1.bin would write out halos 1001-1250 and halos.2.bin would write out halos 251-500. This means the unsorted data[i] array in RSDataReader will not always have the property that data[i] is the halo of id = i.Running Rockstar/P-Gadget3This will be a brief tutorial on running Rockstar/P-Gadget3 using code developed by the MIT group (Brendan, Alex, Greg). So you have a Gadget simulation output and you want to run Rockstar on it.First you&#39;ll need a working version of Rockstar which works with the read modules that we will be using later. As of April 2014, the current version of Rockstar (RC2+ with hdf5 support) works with our modules. Be sure to also get consistent-trees-0.9.9.2.Go to your Rockstar-hdf5 directory and run &quot;make with_hdf5&quot;. If it breaks, you need to point to the hdf5 libraries on your system.HDF5_FLAGS = -DH5_USE_16_API -lhdf5 -DENABLE_HDF5 -I/bigbang/data/bgriffen/lib/hdf5-1.8.10/include -L/bigbang/data/bgriffen/lib/hdf5-1.8.10/lib -lhdf5 -lzGo to your consistent-trees directory and run &quot;make all&quot;.Make a folder inside your Rockstar-hdf5/ directory called &quot;cfgs&quot; where you will put your cfg files.The parent simulation configuration file (parent.cfg) for the MIT halos looks like:PARALLEL_IO = 1PARALLEL_IO_SERVER_INTERFACE = &quot;ib0&quot;FORK_READERS_FROM_WRITERS = 1FORK_PROCESSORS_PER_MACHINE = 16NUM_WRITERS = 128INBASE = /bigbang/data/AnnaGroup/caterpillar/parent/gL100X10/outputsFILENAME = snapdir_&lt;snap&gt;/snap_&lt;snap&gt;.&lt;block&gt;.hdf5 NUM_BLOCKS = 256                       FILE_FORMAT = &quot;AREPO&quot;            FULL_PARTICLE_CHUNKS = 1             OUTBASE=/bigbang/data/AnnaGroup/caterpillar/parent/gL100X10/RockstarAREPO_LENGTH_CONVERSION=1AREPO_MASS_CONVERSION=1e+10SNAPSHOT_NAMES=/bigbang/data/AnnaGroup/caterpillar/parent/gL100X10/Rockstar/snapparent.datFORCE_RES=0.002OUTPUT_FORMAT = &quot;BOTH&quot;You&#39;ll have to modify this to suite your needs. This is suited for infiniband using 16 cores per machine and NUM_WRITERS = Nnodes*Ncores being used. NUM_BLOCKS is also for the number of input files for a given snapshot which you specified for Gadget. You can leave it as AREPO as this is just default for using the HDF5 snapshots. You just need to make sure you set the LENGTH and MASS conversions correctly. The ones above are native for P-Gadget3. Be also sure to get FORCE_RES or force softening correct. Here we use 1/40 times the mean inter-particle separation or (1/40)*boxwidth/(np)^(1/3) which in our case is 100/2^10/40 ~ 0.002. If you have the space, I would suggest leaving OUTPUT_FORMAT to be BOTH. You can clean up the files you don&#39;t want later. Snapshot names is just a file listing the snapshot names 000,001,002 ... up to the number of snaps, 127 in this case.You will then have to submit the Rockstar run to the cluster. For a cluster like Stampede or other SLURM build systems you can adapt the following:#!/bin/bash#SBATCH -o parentrock.o%j#SBATCH -e parentrock.e%j#SBATCH -t 48:00:00#SBATCH -p normal#SBATCH --mail-user=bgriffen@mit.edu#SBATCH -J parentrock#SBATCH --mail-type=ALL#SBATCH -n 512module load hdf5rsdir=/home1/02670/bgriffen/Rockstarexe=/home1/02670/bgriffen/Rockstar/rockstarcd $rsdiroutdir=/scratch/02670/bgriffen/gL100X10/Rockstar$exe -c $rsdir/cfgs/parent.cfg &amp;#$exe -c $outdir/restart.cfg &amp; #only use for restarting the run, comment line above.cd $outdirperl -e &#39;sleep 1 while (!(-e &quot;auto-rockstar.cfg&quot;))&#39;srun -n 512 $exe -c auto-rockstar.cfgIf you are running on PBS, please email Brendan Griffen for a PBS version which works just as well."

Either increase the amount of memory requested by --mem or --mem-per-cpu or, if possible, reduce the amount your application is trying to use. For example, many Java programs set heap space using the -Xmx JVM option. This could potentially be reduced.slurm_receive_msg: Socket timed out on send/recv operationThis message indicates a failure of the SLURM controller. Though there are many possible explanations, it is generally due to an overwhelming number of jobs being submitted, or, occasionally, finishing simultaneously. If you want to figure out if SLURM is working use the sdiag command. sdiag should respond quickly in these situations and give you an idea as to what the scheduler is up to.JOB &lt;jobid&gt; CANCELLED AT &lt;time&gt; DUE TO NODE FAILUREThis message may arise for a variety of reasons, but it indicates that the host on which your job was running can no longer be contacted by SLURM.Again, see the Harvard FAS SLURM website for extra information and help."

"body": "Stampede: the Caterpillar work horseAs per XSEDE website.The TACC Stampede system is a 10 PFLOPS (PF) Dell Linux Cluster based on 6,400+ Dell PowerEdge server nodes, each outfitted with 2 Intel Xeon E5 (Sandy Bridge) processors and an Intel Xeon Phi Coprocessor (MIC Architecture). The aggregate peak performance of the Xeon E5 processors is 2+PF, while the Xeon Phi processors deliver an additional aggregate peak performance of 7+PF. The system also includes a set of login nodes, large-memory nodes, graphics nodes (for both remote visualization and computation), and dual-coprocessor nodes. Additional nodes (not directly accessible to users) provide management and file system services.One of the important design considerations for Stampede was to create a multi-use cyberinfrastructure resource, offering large memory, large data transfer, and GPU capabilities for data-intensive, accelerated or visualization computing. By augmenting some of the compute-intensive nodes within the system with very large memory and GPUs there is no need to move data for data-intensive computing, remote visualization and GPGPU computing. For those situations requiring large-data transfers from other sites, 4 high-speed data servers have been integrated into the Lustre file systems.Compute Nodes: The majority of the 6400 nodes are configured with two Xeon E5-2680 processors and one Intel Xeon Phi SE10P Coprocessor (on a PCIe card). These compute nodes are configured with 32GB of &quot;host&quot; memory with an additional 8GB of memory on the Xeon Phi coprocessor card. A smaller number of compute nodes are configured with two Xeon Phi Coprocessors -- the specific number of nodes available in each configuration at any time will be available from the batch queue summary.Large Memory Nodes: There are an additional 16 large-memory nodes with 32 cores/node and 1TB of memory for data-intense applications requiring disk caching to memory and large-memory methods.Visualization Nodes: For visualization and GPGPU processing 128 compute nodes are augmented with a single NVIDIA K20 GPU on each node with 5GB of on-board GDDR5 memory.File Systems: The Stampede system supports a 14PB global, parallel file storage managed as three Lustre file systems. Each node contains a local 250GB disk. Also, the TACC Ranch tape archival system (60 PB capacity) is accessible from Stampede.Interconnect: Nodes are interconnected with Mellanox FDR InfiniBand technology in a 2-level (cores and leafs) fat-tree topology.Notes about running Caterpillar halos on stampede:You need to specify a minimum 512 cores (-N 32 -n 512) to get started. Depending on the error you should change the following parameters in order and try again.Config.sh: DOUBLEPRECISION_FFTWConfig.sh: MULTIPLEDOMAINS 16 -&gt; 32param.txt.: Buffersize 100 -&gt; 50param.txt: MaxMemSize 3300"

The far left is an LX11 run and the far right is an LX14 run. Note:  The LX15 run has currently only been run for one of the halos and has been temporarily paused at z = 1. This will be finished with a few others once the main suite has been completed. Warning:  Timesteps are spaced logarithmically in expansion factor to z = 6, then linearly spaced in expansion factor down to z = 0. Always be aware of this as it could be strength and a weakness of your study.We have complete (modified) rockstar halo catalogues (together with consistent-trees merger trees) and z = 0 subfind catalogues.Contamination StudyA number of contamination studies have been carried out. This involves changing the Lagrangian geometry in some way to keep the contamination (distance to the nearest particle type 2 as far as possible) low whilst conserving CPU hours. Our selected test geometries were as followsGeometryDetailBAOriginal MUSIC bounding box (e.g. the exact bounding box of lagr volume).BB1.2 bounding box extentBC1.4 bounding box extentBD1.6 bounding box extentCAConvex Hull VolumeEAOriginal MUSIC ellipsoid (e.g. the exact bounding box of lagr volume).EB1.1 paddingEC1.2 paddingEX1.05 paddingWe did this for both 4 and 5 times the virial radius at z = 0 (marked by the letter 4 or 5 at the end of the abbreviated geometry). Making a total of ~18 test halos per Caterpillar halo. Our requirement was that there was no contamation (particle type 2) within 1 Mpc of the host at the LX11 level.We also looked at how the geometry of the lagrangian volume affected the contamination radius. As outlined in Griffen et al. (2015), we did not find any correlation with geometry and overall level contamination. Every simulation requires its own tailored geometry to achieve our contamination requirements.The size of the lagrangian volumes were also another challenge to overcome. If a halo had LX11 ICs which were larger than 300mb, we found that we could not run these at LX14 on national facilities. The size and distance became our two biggest obstacles when running the Caterpillar suite.Our rockstar catalogues only use the high-resolution particles. This means that there will be halos in the outskirts of the simulation which are contaminated. These are shown clearly below. Be sure not to just take all halos within the rockstar catalogues as some of them will be contaminated (underestimated masses, wrong profiles etc.). As a safety, one should only take halos which are within the contamination distance. This changes as a function of redshift so make sure you update your cut for each snapshot. The plots below are for z = 0."
